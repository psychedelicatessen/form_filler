A simple form filler program written in python3.

Dependencies:
openpyxl

Compile the source on the commandline and follow the prompts to fill out a
template form (an example of the handled template is included in the
repository).

The code is created to handle the included template and other excel
spreadsheet forms were not considered during the creation of this code.

This code is provided under no warranty, explicit or implied, free of charge
and freely available to use, change, or whatever your heart desires.


How to use:

Make sure you have python3 installed with the template excel file you will use
in the same directory (folder). Then, on a commandline, simply:

python form.py

and follow the on screen instructions.
